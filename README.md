### Hi, My name is Dexter Heyrana, but you can call me Dex.

---

### I love to Play Basketball and Volleyball .

---

### My Goal this year is to be a better version of myself and get a job as a web developer

---

### I chose to become a web developer because I could make a living wage, create amazing work that people use everyday, and further my education without having to go back to school
